    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>
    The history of <strong>Palestine</strong> stretches back thousands of years, making it one of the oldest regions inhabited by humans. Ancient civilizations such as the <em>Canaanites</em> and <em>Philistines</em> once thrived in this land, which later became significant in the rise of major religions including <b>Judaism</b>, <b>Christianity</b>, and <b>Islam</b>. Its location at the crossroads of Africa and Asia made it a vital center for trade, culture, and conquest throughout antiquity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    During the <strong>Roman</strong> and later the <em>Byzantine</em> periods, Palestine saw major transformations, including the spread of Christianity. The region was subsequently conquered by <b>Arab Muslim</b> forces in the 7th century, leading to centuries of Islamic rule. Under the <em>Ottoman Empire</em>, which governed the area from the early 16th century until World War I, Palestine maintained a largely agricultural and multiethnic character.

    <p>
    After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the land came under <strong>British Mandate</strong> control, a period that saw increasing tensions between <em>Jewish</em> and <em>Arab</em> communities. In 1948, the establishment of the <b>State of Israel</b> and the subsequent <strong>Arab-Israeli conflict</strong> dramatically reshaped the region. Since then, the struggle for <em>Palestinian self-determination</em> and sovereignty has continued, defining much of the modern political landscape of the Middle East.
