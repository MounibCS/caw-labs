        Since the start of the war on <strong>October 7, 2023</strong>, the people of Gaza have endured catastrophic human
        and material losses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
        over <strong>63,700 people</strong> have been killed and more than <strong>161,000 injured</strong> as of mid-2025.
        Nearly <strong>70% of the victims are women and children</strong>, highlighting the devastating civilian toll of the conflict.

        The destruction extends beyond human lives. The WHO reports that <strong>94% of hospitals in Gaza</strong> have been
        damaged or destroyed, and access to food, water, and medicine remains critically limited. Malnutrition has surged,
        with dozens of children dying from hunger and dehydration each month. The Nature analysis estimates the total death toll could exceed <strong>84,000</strong> when accounting for unreported casualties.

        Residential areas, schools, and shelters have been leveled. The Lancet estimates that direct and indirect
        deaths from bombing, hunger, and disease could surpass <strong>64,000 by mid-2024</strong>. Millions have been displaced,
        and thousands of families have lost multiple generations in single airstrikes. International organizations have called
        for urgent humanitarian corridors and long-term rebuilding to prevent further loss of life.
